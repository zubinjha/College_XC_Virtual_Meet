## What It Does

Different cross country courses can vary a lot in speed and difficulty. This makes comparing results from different races tricky. This tool helps coaches simulate upcoming championship meets by combining past performances and adjusting for time differences.

You give the app one or more TFRRS links, select which teams to include, apply optional time adjustments (for example, +7 seconds), and it builds a virtual meet for you.

From there, you can:

- Add new runners
- Remove runners
- Change a runner’s placement
- Export the results to Excel

Note: Runners added manually won’t count towards team scores until the team has at least five runners.
