## What It Does

Cross country courses and races can vary significantly in speed. This tool helps preview upcoming meets by combining multiple race performances and adjusting for course speed differences.

You give the app one or more TFRRS links, select which teams to include, apply optional time adjustments (for example, +7 seconds), and it builds a virtual meet for you.

From there, you can:

- Add new runners
- Remove runners
- Change a runner’s placement
- Export the results to Excel

Note: Runners added manually won’t count towards team scores until the team has at least five runners.

## Additional Notes

- Exported Excel files include individual results and team scores side by side.
- On Windows, the text fields can occasionally be buggy. If this happens, try clicking outside the application and then back into it before typing.
